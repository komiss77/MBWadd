Hello! It starts to seem to me that we are walking in a circle.
In Discussion you ask to write in Conversations, in Conversations  you ask to write in a Discord, in a Discord suggest write in Conversations...
Time goes by, bugs are not fixed. Legacy plugin support with new versions of the server will not last forever.
I’ll try to post a list of problems here, maybe this will draw your attention.


[SPOILER="BUGS"]

[/SPOILER]
[/SPOILER]

[SPOILER="REQUEST"]
Lobby Countdown messages "start" do nor spam in chat, move it to actionbar
Add arenaStatus preStart (prestart countdown)
Spectator to player teleport - location.add(0,3,0)
Add SpectateReason in PlayerQuitArenaSpectatorEvent and PlayerJoinArenaSpectatorEvent
Move autobalace option to team select menu (dissalow team choise if disbalance) (now - can create disbalaced team, and schufle player after round start? it`s not good)
Lobby teleport not in one point (mash), do small dispersion with location.add ( rnd(-2,+2), 0, rnd(-2,+2))
Team displayName different per every map (not a (red,blue) for all, e.t.c. map1(red=hobbits,blue=orcs);map2(green=jedi,blue=sith)

Add arena api methods:
- arena.getRoundRemainingTime()
- arena.getCooldownTime() (for arenaState preStart)
- openAchivMenu (player)
[/SPOILER]


[SPOILER="POSSIBLE"]
Game timer change color (40% time left - yellow, 10% time left - red)
If player disconnect (bed is not broken), after relog back to game, kill it, and respawn with message "you back to game". If bed brocken, after relog move to spectator.
Arena statistic save and show in arena select gui menu: gameplayed, middle round time
Dissalow spectator switch fly-off
If spectator take void damage - back to arena spectator point
[/SPOILER]

[SPOILER="BIG JOB"]
Recode the voting system. The fake votearena is ugly variant (votearena - votelobby - team select - votearena start join to voteWin arena - one more team select - that's horrible!!!)
Must be lobby - vote & team select - voteWin arena start !!!!!!
[/SPOILER]






I’m a little awkward, but I don’t speak conversational foreign. I`m about BW plugin errors.
Since the last bug found with a menu error caused the arena to freeze, you still had to slightly modify your code in the de.marcely.bedwars.api.gui.GUI.open(Player) 
int slots = height*9; ->> int slots = (height*9==0 ? 9 :  height*9);
It is a crutch and does not eliminate the cause, but solves the problem. 
I would like to know what you think about other issues that I wrote in the conversation?




Hello! In addition to what I informed you in conversation.
I found another critical bug. 
if someone in the lobby looks in the gui selection menu, and someone in the arena quits the game or arena end round, 
a failure occurs in the updated menu, and the arena freezes or the regeneration does not end. Finita la comedi..

You may already be tired of me, but I bought your plugin to save time on updating my old plugin. 
Now I have already spent so much time setting up yours, but it is still not stable, 
and it is impossible to fix something in the plugin core due to obfuscation. 
It begins to seem to me that the purchase was a mistake and I had to finish my own, which may have to be returned soon ..

With all these improvements, the plugin will be much more userful.
