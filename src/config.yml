# ========== AUTOMATIC ARENA CLONEING ==========

# [BETA] This is a feature that automatically creates duplicates of arenas so that there are always arenas available for one to join
# The whole system is basically fully automatic. After a cloned arena has gone through a match, it will be deleted and a new one is being generated
# It works with both region and world arenas
# In case your arena is a world, a new world is being temporarily created while the arena exists. This occurs with every cloned arena, meaning that you might experience a large increase in worlds count and RAM usage
# If your arena is instead a region, then all cloned match areas are being collected in a single world. There's an offset with each one, meaning that they won't collide with each other
# However, keep in mind that it makes sense to use this together with the "lobbybreak-enabled" config in case you've got arenas of the type region as the lobby itself is not being cloned
# In case that config is enabled, the lobby of the cloned arena is being aligned to match the one that was copied using the copy of the playable area
# If that config is disabled, then all players of the cloned arenas and the normal one will be brought into the one that has been configured
# It could make sense to instead enable "tab-removenonplayers" as the players from the other arenas won't be seen with that

# Enabling this config will spawn a hologram above every living bed with the message of the config 'bed-hologram-message-alive'
